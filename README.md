# Lycon

Lycon is an app for iOS and Android devices made to match photographers and models that want to works together. It have a simple screen that you can swipe as a photographer the models that you want to work with. After make a match, you will able to chat with your model. 

## Made with Flutterüõ†Ô∏è

Lycon is made with Flutter language that is based in Dart. I choosed this option basiclly for the easiest funcionallitys to make mobile apps for both platforms (iOS / Android) without code two different apps with native languages.

Also you can reach a good design in your UI without excessive effort.
